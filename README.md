# 📝 Text Summarization Using NLP and Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on **extractive and abstractive text summarization** using advanced NLP techniques and deep learning models. The goal is to automatically generate concise and coherent summaries from long texts, enabling faster information consumption and better content understanding.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📄 **Text Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.
- 🤖 **Model Architectures**:
  - Seq2Seq with attention
  - Transformers (BERT, T5)
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses ROUGE, BLEU, and accuracy to evaluate summary quality.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Details

### 📁 Dataset

Uses common summarization datasets like:

- CNN/DailyMail
- Gigaword
- Custom datasets (if applicable)

### 🔍 Preprocessing

- Text cleaning (removing special characters, punctuation, etc.)
- Tokenization using `spaCy` or `NLTK`
- Sequence padding for uniform input size

### 🧱 Model Architecture

- **Encoder**: Captures context from the input document.
- **Decoder**: Generates the summary text.
- **Attention Layer**: Improves focus on important words during decoding.

---

## 🏋️ Training

- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Validation**: Early stopping and model checkpointing based on ROUGE score

---

## 📈 Evaluation

- **ROUGE Score**: Measures overlap of n-grams between predicted and reference summaries.
- **BLEU Score**: Evaluates precision of predicted sequences.
- **Sample Outputs**: Side-by-side comparison of original text and generated summary.
